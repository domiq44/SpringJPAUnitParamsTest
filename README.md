# SpringJPAUnitParamsTest
Demo project for Spring Boot JPA Unit Parameterized Test

It's a fork from https://grokonez.com/testing/datajpatest-with-spring-boot
By grokonez | February 6, 2017.

grokonez used @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) and Spring, so no parameterized test possible.

Now I use now @RunWith(JUnitParamsRunner.class) with @ClassRule and @Rule to use Spring.

Have fun!
